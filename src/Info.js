      Mango contains long seeds, which can make it tough to slice. Peak season
      runs from May through September, though you can find imported mangoes at
      your market all-year round. A cup of sliced mango contains 107 calories,
      28 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and contains over 20 vitamins
      and minerals.
